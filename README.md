## Introduction
Simply and quickly connect a Bot to your Discord server, and make him play sounds and musics of your choice by using a Web-interface. 
All your users will be able to play with sounds to emphasize funny discussion/gaming moments !


This is a rewrite of my existing project using GO language.
Legacy version using nodeJS is here : ![https://github.com/adrien-sk/Discord-Web-Soundboard-Legacy](https://github.com/adrien-sk/Discord-Web-Soundboard-Legacy)
